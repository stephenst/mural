  This guide serves as the coding standard for all JavaScript code. 
  It should be regularly revised and understood by front dev teams.

  ### General
  
  - All code and comments are written in succinct professional English
  - Line length should be limited to a "screen width" which can vary between 100 and 200 characters
  - Line length should be set to a hard wrap at 120 characters.  You can extend past this as variables can be long; but aim to break to the next line.
  - Consistency, readability, simplicity are ultimate goals
  - Use one of the approved editors (IntelliJ, Webstorm, SublimeText).  
  - Ensure support of .editorconfig files.
  - Use lint tools to test.  (JSHint, SCSSLint, ES6Lint...)
